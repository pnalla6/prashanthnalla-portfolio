            Hey there! I'm Prashanth, a Master of Science in Computer and Information Science student at the University
            at Buffalo. As a graduate teaching assistant for Operating Systems, I've discovered my passion for helping
            others and sharing my knowledge.

            My technical skills include proficiency in programming languages like Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, C,
            HTML, CSS, and PHP, and databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, NoSQL, MongoDB, and SQLite. I'm also experienced
            in frameworks and tools like Node.js, Spring, Hibernate, Django, Flask, React.js, AngularJS, Vue.js, Mocha,
            JUnit, and AWS.

            But what sets me apart is my ability to work collaboratively with a team and my eagerness to learn new
            things. I've had the privilege of working as a Full Stack Developer at Hans Matrimony, where I developed and
            maintained EazyBe.com websites using React, Redux, JavaScript, Java, Spring, Hibernate, HTML5, CSS3, and
            MySQL. In addition to integrating multiple third-party APIs and building a comprehensive components library,
            I implemented client-side data caching and designed a microservices architecture to improve application
            scalability, performance, and availability.

            Outside of work and school, I'm a huge fan of reading, exploring the great outdoors, and spending time with
            my loved ones. I believe that being a well-rounded individual and fostering personal growth is just as
            important as technical expertise.

            Overall, I'm excited to continue growing and contributing to the field of computer science while maintaining
            a balanced and fulfilling life outside of work.
