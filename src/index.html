            <p> Hey there! I'm Prashanth, a Master of Science in Computer and Information Science student at the
                University
                at Buffalo. As a graduate teaching assistant for Operating Systems, I've discovered my passion for
                helping
                others and sharing my knowledge.

                My technical skills include proficiency in programming languages like Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, C,
                HTML, CSS, and PHP, and databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, NoSQL, MongoDB, and SQLite. I'm also
                experienced
                in frameworks and tools like Node.js, Spring, Hibernate, Django, Flask, React.js, AngularJS, Vue.js,
                Mocha,
                JUnit, and AWS.

                But what sets me apart is my ability to work collaboratively with a team and my eagerness to learn new
                things. I've had the privilege of working as a Full Stack Developer at Hans Matrimony, where I developed
                and
                maintained EazyBe.com websites using React, Redux, JavaScript, Java, Spring, Hibernate, HTML5, CSS3, and
                MySQL. In addition to integrating multiple third-party APIs and building a comprehensive components
                library,
                I implemented client-side data caching and designed a microservices architecture to improve application
                scalability, performance, and availability.

                Outside of work and school, I'm a huge fan of reading, exploring the great outdoors, and spending time
                with
                my loved ones. I believe that being a well-rounded individual and fostering personal growth is just as
                important as technical expertise.

                Overall, I'm excited to continue growing and contributing to the field of computer science while
                maintaining
                a balanced and fulfilling life outside of work.</p>

              <p>During my undergraduate studies, I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at B.V Raju Institute of Technology in India. Those four years were some of the most formative and enriching years of my life. My courses were a mix of theoretical computer science and hands-on programming projects, which helped me to hone my technical skills and problem-solving abilities.</p>
              <p>I was also a member of the college's coding club, which allowed me to collaborate with peers on challenging programming challenges and improve my teamwork skills. Outside of academics, I was involved in organizing cultural events and sports tournaments, which taught me valuable leadership and event management skills.</p>
              <p>Overall, my undergraduate education was a well-rounded experience that prepared me for my future academic and professional pursuits. I am grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow during this time and look forward to continuing my educational journey in the future.</p>

                    <p>As an avid music listener, I wanted to create something that would allow me to visualize music in a creative way. Using my skills in HTML, CSS, and p5.js, I developed a music visualizer that responds to audio inputs and generates a visual representation of the sound waves. This project challenged me to think creatively and outside of the box, as well as allowing me to strengthen my coding skills.</p>
