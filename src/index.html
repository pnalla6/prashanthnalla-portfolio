            <p>As a recent graduate with a Master of Science in Computer Science from the University at Buffalo, I
                possess a passion for problem-solving and a strong foundation in software development. I am confident in
                my ability to make a valuable contribution to any forward-thinking organization in the technology
                industry.</p>
            <br>
            <p> Throughout my academic career, I have gained valuable experience working on cross-functional teams to
                create innovative solutions. I am proficient in programming languages such as Python, JavaScript and
                Java, as well as software tools. Additionally, I possess strong analytical and communication skills that
                enable me to effectively collaborate with colleagues and clients alike.</p>
            <br>
            <p> My ultimate goal is to leverage my education and experience to contribute to the growth and success of a
                technology organization. I am highly motivated to continuously learn and incorporate new technologies
                and methodologies into my work, and I am excited to take on new challenges and become a valuable asset
                to any team in the technology industry.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My technical proficiencies include programming languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, C, HTML,
                CSS, and PHP. I have experience working with databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, NoSQL, MongoDB, and
                SQLite. I am also proficient in frameworks/tools/cloud such as Node.js, Spring, Hibernate, Django,
                Flask, React.js, AngularJS, Vue.js, Redis, Apache Kafka, Mocha, JUnit, and AWS.</p>
            <br>
            <p> I have gained professional experience as a Full Stack Developer, where I developed and maintained
                websites using React, Redux, JavaScript, Java, Spring, Hibernate, HTML5, CSS3, and MySQL. I have also
                worked as an Apprentice at Persistent Systems, where I collaborated with a team of developers to design
                and implement a drone's control system and visual interface using Python and the A* algorithm for
                optimal pathfinding.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In addition to my professional experience, I have contributed to academic projects such as Pintos, where
                I developed various operating system features using C, GDB, and QEMU. I have also contributed to
                OneDataShare.org, an open-source data transfer software, and developed a full-stack web application
                called ReviewScope using ReactJS, Redux, NodeJS, and MongoDB to manage conference roles.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer and Information Science at the University at
                Buffalo, where I also serve as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for CSE 4/521 Operating Systems.</p>

                <p>During my undergraduate studies, I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at
                    B.V Raju Institute of Technology in India. Those four years were some of the most formative and
                    enriching years of my life. My courses were a mix of theoretical computer science and hands-on
                    programming projects, which helped me to hone my technical skills and problem-solving abilities.</p>
                <p>I was also a member of the college's coding club, which allowed me to collaborate with peers on
                    challenging programming challenges and improve my teamwork skills. Outside of academics, I was
                    involved in organizing cultural events and sports tournaments, which taught me valuable leadership
                    and event management skills.</p>
                <p>Overall, my undergraduate education was a well-rounded experience that prepared me for my future
                    academic and professional pursuits. I am grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow during this
                    time and look forward to continuing my educational journey in the future.</p>
